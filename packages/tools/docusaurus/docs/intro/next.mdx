# Next Steps

With all of that introductory stuff out of the way, we recommend following one of the three following paths:

<div ks-theme="docs">
  <Columns columns={3} gutter="md" switchAt={672}>
    <TeaserBox
      link={{
        size: 'small',
        href: '/docs/guides/create/',
        label: 'Follow main guide',
        variant: 'clear',
        iconAnimation: true,
        iconAfter: {
          icon: 'chevron-right',
        },
      }}
      text="Follow our main guide **Create your Design System**. Learn everything from scratch, with detailed interactive guides. Learn implementing components in 4 different ways!"
      topic="Keep Learning"
    />
    <TeaserBox
      link={{
        size: 'small',
        href: '/docs/guides/use-our-starter',
        label: 'Clone Starter',
        variant: 'clear',
        iconAnimation: true,
        iconAfter: {
          icon: 'chevron-right',
        },
      }}
      text="Directly start with our **Design System Starter**. Clone our template repository on Github, and get programming immediately. Includes the 4 components of the main guide!"
      topic="Start Coding"
    />
    <TeaserBox
      link={{
        size: 'small',
        href: '/docs/guides/design-system-iniative',
        label: 'Define Scope',
        variant: 'clear',
        iconAnimation: true,
        iconAfter: {
          icon: 'chevron-right',
        },
      }}
      text="Learn about the **Design System Initiative**. This can help in getting an idea of the involved stakeholers, needed component scope, order of implementation, and the best pilot project."
      topic="Take Initiative"
    />
