# Roadmap

As we just released kickstartDS with the first version of this documentation, we know, that we still have to work on many details to let our documentation shine. As we want to explain the underlaying concepts in-depth. ake a look at each stage to see which features we've launched, worked on, or planned for future releases. If we're missing something, let us know at hello@kickstartds.com.

## v2.0

## v1.5

## Community

We try to have a healthy, friendly and active community. As we believe in the great openness of the Design System community. We rely on your feedback by adapting to your needs, so that kickstartDS will really become the Design System starter, digital teams and the community like to work with.

Although it's still quite small, this also enables us to respond to requests in a very hands-on fashion.
