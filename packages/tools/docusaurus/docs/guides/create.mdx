# Create your Design System

## Overview

5 steps to a successful Design System!

TODO add link to video version on YouTube

## 1. Start your Design System

Setting up your own Design System can be done in one of two ways:

1. [Creating a new project](#create-new-project) for your Design System to live in, or
2. [adding everything to an existing project](#add-to-existing-project)

TODO add CLI link

### Create new project

Start in a fresh directory inside your terminal. This should be the directory all your Design System code will live in, and that will also be pushed to a Git host, later on. It shouldn't include a `.git` folder, yet! We'll use `~/projects/my-design-system` here, with `~` denoting the users' home directory.

First, let's create a `Git` repository:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/projects/my-design-system
$ cd ~/projects/my-design-system
$ git init

> Initialized empty Git repository in ~/projects/my-design-system/.git/
```

Next we'll make it a valid `npm` package, too:

```bash
$ npm init

> About to write to ~/projects/my-design-system/package.json:
> ...
```

<CH.Section>

Enter the prompted information, and you'll end up with a `package.json` describing your freshly made `npm` package. Use `dist/index.js` for the [entry point](focus://5), this is where our bundled code will live. The rest is pretty much up to your liking! It should look roughly like this:

```json package.json mark=5[12:24]
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Working with the terminal">
  If any of the commands related to `git` or `npm` / `node` fail for you, or you need help working with the terminal, have a look at our `Getting Started` [page about Environment configuration](../intro/environment/index.md).

Additionally you might not use `nvm` for `Node` version management. Just skip those sections, and ensure the correct version for your project is installed and active!

</Admonition>
</CH.Section>

<CH.Section>
Next we'll add a `.nvmrc` file specifying the use of `Node` `16.14` for this project (this is the version **kickstartDS** currently works off of) to our project root:

<CH.Code>
```bash .nvmrc
16.14
```

```json package.json
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

</CH.Code>

</CH.Section>

Call `nvm use` right after, to activate the correct `Node` and `npm` versions:

```bash
$ nvm use

> Found '~/projects/my-design-system/.nvmrc' with version <16.14>
> Now using node v16.14.2 (npm v8.19.2)
```

With this you can continue with `Add to existing project`. From here on out the steps will be the same.<br/>
You'll just find that, in comparison to having an existing project, you'll probably not find any of the steps to be optional!

### Add to existing project

In your terminal, switch to the project that you want to add **kickstartDS** to first. We'll be adding some dependencies, some glue code and configuration to hook everything up.

Some of the following steps might be optional for your personal setup, so feel free to skip them.<br/>
For example: you might already have `React` installed in your project, so you wouldn't have to complete that part of the setup!

<Admonition type="tip" title="`npm` vs `yarn` vs ...">
  In this guide we'll be using `yarn` as our package manager of choice. Feel free to use your preferred solution instead.<br/>
  For more details see our [page about Environment configuration](../intro/environment/index.md).

_For example_: if you were using `npm`, and you'd encounter the following command to run `yarn add react@17 react-dom@17`... just replace `yarn` with `npm` and run `npm add react@17 react-dom@17` instead.

#### Dependencies

First of all we need to add some dependencies to our project:

<CH.Scrollycoding>
##### Start with existing `package.json`

If you're adding to an existing project, just imagine the same lines being added to your existing `package.json`.<br/>
We'll pretend to start fresh:

<CH.Code>
```json package.json
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

##### Add `React`

<CH.Code>
```json package.json focus=11:14
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "17",
    "react-dom": "17"
  }
}
```
</CH.Code>

If your project was not using `React` before, you should add a compatible version (**kickstartDS** currently uses `React 17`) of it now:

```bash
$ yarn add react@17 react-dom@17
```

---

##### Add `kickstartDS`

<CH.Code>
```json package.json focus=12
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@kickstartds/base": "2.0.0-canary.922.4865.0",
    "react": "17",
    "react-dom": "17"
  }
}
```
</CH.Code>

Next we'll add the `kickstartDS` dependencies themselves. We start out by adding our `base` module (`@kickstartds/base`), which contains all of the base components, to get started:

```bash
$ yarn add @kickstartds/base@2.0.0-canary.922.4865.0
```

Learn more about the different modules **kickstartDS** has to offer in our [overview here](#). TODO link to overview of modules here

</CH.Scrollycoding>

This will leave us with the following files for now, at least if you've started fresh:

<CH.Section>
<CH.Code>
```json package.json
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@kickstartds/base": "2.0.0-canary.922.4865.0",
    "react": "17",
    "react-dom": "17"
  }
}
```

```bash .nvmrc
16.14
```

</CH.Code>
</CH.Section>

We'll continue by applying our branding to **kickstartDS**, which will result in a bunch of token files (`JSON`) being added.<br/>
This will also give us the opportunity to set up `Storybook`, and get a first visual representation of our Design System in the browser!
