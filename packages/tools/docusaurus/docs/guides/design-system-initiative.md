# Design System Initiative

A **Design System Initiative** is the process an organization undertakes when considering to initialize a Design System. This generally occurs in a couple of steps where usually different kinds of workshops are run. It starts way before the pure design and development process itself by impacting many disciplines and stakeholders within the organization.

## What are typical steps of a Design System Initiative?

We all know, that in every org there are stakeholders to be involoved, different kind of tools from design to development, existing rules and guidelines to consider and new principles to establish. Usable components to build, tokens to create, docs to write and much more.

A Design System Initiative includes audits of existing interfaces and a user research process to gain as much insights to make better decisions during the initiative. It is important to know your stakeholders and their involvement as the implementation of a Design System often can become a political journey as well.

In the past years, working with clients, the kickstartDS team worked out a workshop format which considers all the important steps and phases. It will be adapted to the individual needs of each company hiring us. We appreciate if you want to know more about our **[Design System Services here](https://www.kickstartds.com/services/)**.

During the initiative we usually run around seven to nine workshops including stakeholder mapping, exploring your current inventory as the baseline to synthesize to what should be real core components, in parallel we will sound out a strategy for the technical implementation and ultimately, we will identify a product serving as the potential pilot project.
