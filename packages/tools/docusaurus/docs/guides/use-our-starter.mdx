## About

The **kickstartDS Design System Starter** is your most efficient way of kickstarting a **Design System**. It creates a ready-to-use **Design System**, only waiting for you to put your stamp on it! Next to some additional features and configuration, the content of this starter is strongly aligned with our main guide ["Create your **Design System**"](./create/index.mdx). This means you can use that guide as a detailed reference for the way stuff works, and learn about the reasoning behind those decisions.

## Overview

This **Starter** repository can serve as the starting point for **your own Design System**. It only includes minimal, but illustrative, example components and integrations. The selected components should be useful in every **Design System** by themselves, but they're specifically used to showcase features and best practices at play in **kickstartDS**, and to make it easier for you to just add stuff to an already working, well-oiled system.

We have extensive documentation building up most of the code you'll find in this starter from scratch. The respective guide ["Create your Design System"](./create/index.mdx) can thus serve as a great reference whilst exploring this starter on your own, or when having specific questions about a feature or integration.

### Feature list

The following is a list of included features, that are pre-configured for immediate use:

- Ready-to-start, fully functional **Design System**
- Pre-configured semantic token structure ([**Branding Token**](../foundations/token/branding-token.mdx), [**Design Token**](../foundations/token/design-token/index.md) and [**Component Token**](../foundations/token/component-token.mdx))
- [**Branding Token**](../foundations/token/branding-token.mdx) file for quick application of CI / CD
- Three exemplary components ([`Button`](https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/examples/components/button), [`Headline`](https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/examples/components/headline) and [`TeaserCard`](https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/examples/components/teaser-card)) and a layout element ([`Section`](https://www.kickstartds.com/docs/guides/examples/components/section))
- Full page demo, recipe demo and rudimentary demo docs
- [**Storybook**](https://storybook.js.org/) with best-practice configuration, **kickstartDS** integration, addons and composition
- **Hot reload** for **all** code changes: **Design Token** set, **JSON Schema**, **CSS** / **SCSS**, **JavaScript** and **React** templates
- [**Playroom**](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom) integration for prototyping
- Bundling of **Design System** for use with _and_ without [**React**](https://reactjs.org/)
- Automatic, semantic release handling using [**auto**](https://intuit.github.io/auto/)
- CI / CD integration for [**Circle CI**](https://circleci.com/)

See the dedicated section about [the main features](#features) below for more detailed descriptions.

## Installation

There's not really anything you need to install globally to use **kickstartDS**. But as it is **Node.js** based, you'll have to have that at the ready. This starter (just like the rest of **kickstartDS**) tracks the current LTS release, switching to new ones as soon as all the tooling has stabilized.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Install Node.js with nvm">
  We recommend managing your local **Node.js** versions using
  [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Read through the corresponding
  [section in our docs](../intro/environment.md#usage-with-nvm).
</Admonition>

To learn more generally about the optimal environment to work with **kickstartDS** have a look at the [Environment](../intro/environment.md) page in [our docs](https://www.kickstartds.com/docs).

## Getting started (in 5 minutes)

Let's get started creating your own **Design System**! We should be done with the basic setup in just 5 easy steps, taking you 5 minutes max!

### 1. Create from template

First thing is creating your repository based on this template. This will be the repository you manage your **Design System** in, your central source of truth!

Just follow this excellent guide by **Github** themselves:<br/>
[Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)

Alternatively you can also just fork / clone the repository, and host your code how- and wherever you like. There's no further dependency on **Github** here... it's just convenient.

As a last step, simply clone your freshly made repository, and switch into its directory in preparation for the next step.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Clone? Directory? Huh...">
  Not sure where anything like this would happen? Have a look at the ["Terminal"
  section](../intro/environment.md#terminal) in our docs.
</Admonition>

### 2. Update `package.json`

After checkout, you should start by adding some meta info to `package.json`... like `name` for the name of your project. Among other things, this will also decide the name your **Design System** will be [published under in **npm**](#bundling). Other fields you might want to change include: `version`, `description`, `homepage`, `license` and `author`. Have a look at [the **npm** docs for `package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/package-json) for all the juicy details.

And while at it, you should probably also change the author in the following files:

- `COPYRIGHT.md`
- `LICENSE-APACHE`
- `LICENSE-MIT`
- `README.md`
- `.autorc`

### 3. Add your own logo

Last thing to do before installing and starting everything is to replace the placeholder logo with your own one. Just replace `static/logo.svg`, and you should be good to go!

<Admonition type="tip" title="Other image formats">
  If you don't have a `.svg` file for your logo (you really should have one!),
  you can just put that file into the `static/` folder, and change the reference
  in `.storybook/themes.js` to point to that instead.
</Admonition>

### 4. Install dependencies

Continue by checking your **Node.js** version (or execute `nvm use` if you opted for [the **nvm** route](../intro/environment.md#usage-with-nvm)) with `node --version`. It should output `16.14` for this starter.

Follow this with a **yarn** or **npm** install:

```
yarn install
```

```
npm install
```

This should set up all the needed dependencies. It could take a while the first time around, so while that's running... why not take a peek at [the features section](#features)?

<Admonition type="tip" title="Using npm">
We use `yarn` for package management ourselves, including their workspaces feature...

Just replace commands prefixed with `yarn` by their corresponding `npm` equivalents if using **npm**

</Admonition>

### 5. Start **Storybook**

When the installation of dependencies is done, everything should be ready to start your own **Design System** for the very first time:

```
yarn start
```

**Storybook** should automatically open in your preferred browser, showing you a demo "Welcome" page with some dummy content.

`yarn start` here is actually an alias starting all configured watch tasks, in parallel to also starting **Storybook** in watch mode. This ensures that whatever file you edit, you should have hot reload while working on your code!

Have a look at the next section for inspiration on what the next steps could look like on the journey to your customized **Design System**.

## Next steps

Where you take it next is pretty much up to you completely. There are some things one would pretty much always want to do (e.g. [Customizing Design Token](#customizing-design-token)), while others might be optional. In which order you tackle those shouldn't make a difference, just choose what fancies you the most!

### Customizing **Design Token**

When getting started with your **Design System**, you will find the current **Design Token** set to be pretty bland and boring... this is because you are looking at the default, pretty much unstyled versions of components.

There are two concepts involved with design and token application in **kickstartDS**:

1. [**Branding Token**](../foundations/token/branding-token.mdx): Small set of expressive values to seed your initial **Design Token** set
2. [**Design Token**](../foundations/token/design-token/index.md): Managed **Style Dictionary** containing your semantic **Design Token** set

**Branding Token** are set in `src/token/branding-token.json`, while your **Design Token** set lives at `src/token/dictionary`. Initialization of token happens through `yarn init-tokens`, while compiling your **Design Token** set to **Component Token** (among other formats) is done by running `yarn build-tokens`.

[**Component Token**](../foundations/token/component-token.mdx) are the third type of token involved, but those only come into play later. They are not concerned with the general styling / theming of your **Design System**, but rather map your **Design Token** set to components in a layered way.

To learn more about this process, follow the section ["2. Design Application"](./create/design.mdx) of our ["Create your Design System"](./create/index.mdx) guide.

### Adding components

As described in the intro to this `README`, the components already included serve as a great example on how to leverage **kickstartDS**. But obviously you will want to add your own components, suited to exactly your needs!

We have to tried to outline this process of component creation, and all its aspects, in our documentation. All the components included with this starter get created in part of ["4. Add Components"](./create/components.mdx) of our main guide ["Create your Design System"](./create/index.mdx). You can use that guide to cross-reference the thought process behind the components already included, and it should give you a good idea on how to approach your own ones.

You can have a look at all the component examples in [our guides here](./examples/components/index.md), or learn about the involved processes in more detail in the ["Components"](./components/index.mdx) subsection.

Futher, all the aspects making up a component are described as part of the ["Component"](../foundations/components/index.mdx) subsection under ["Foundations"](../foundations/index.mdx).

If unsure on what components you actually need, or which ones to tackle first, you could investigate starting your own [Design System Initiative](./design-system-initiative.md). We also wrote about it [in a blog post](https://www.kickstartds.com/blog/how-our-initiative-workshop-series-helps-customers-to-decide-for-or-against-a-design-system/), and [offer support in executing one](https://www.kickstartds.com/services/)... if you still feel like you need a helping hand!

### Dig into our docs

We have added a lot of links to specific docs sections in all the other paragraphs already. But they deserve a special mention here. Creating a **Design System** can be both highly custom and opinionated. This is why we think explaining our reasoning in detail, especially when we take decisions for you (like using **Style Dictionary**), is super important. And for areas where there is no clear cut decision to take, we always try to add recommendations (like how to best construct your components to [avoid adding technical debt](./components/index.mdx#technical-debt-added)) instead.

Some quick links to get you started:

## Features

This starter is already quite rich in features that are enabled out-of-the-box for you. To give you some orientation, while also describing the intention behind features, and ensuring you can actually make the most out of your **Design System**.

### **Design Token** integration

One important part of a **Design System** is having a well structured and semantic token system in place. Learn about customizing your **Design Token** set in [our dedicated section above](#design-token-integration), helping you to adapt your own branding / CI / CD.

**Design Token** can be initialized by changing the values in `src/token/branding-token.json` and calling `yarn init-tokens`, and compiled to **CSS Custom Properties** by running `yarn build-tokens`. While `yarn init-tokens` generates your **Design Token** set in `src/token/dictionary`, `yarn build-tokens` reads it from there, and outputs the resulting formats (which **CSS Custom Properties** is just one of) according to your **Style Dictionary** config.

We already include a minimal **Style Dictionary** configuration as part of our [**CLI**](../intro/cli.mdx), but you can overwrite this configuration by adding a `sd.config.cjs` to your repository root. Explore that file for details on the formats configured in this starter (the path the format output is written to can be influenced by setting `buildPath`):

| Platform      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **css**       | Creates a `token.css` file including all of your [**Design Token**](../foundations/token/design-token/index.md) converted to **CSS Custom Properties**, using the naming structure expected by [**Component Token**](../foundations/token/component-token.mdx) in `src/token`                                                                                                                 |
| **html**      | **HTML** icon sprite ([learn more](https://css-tricks.com/svg-sprites-use-better-icon-fonts/)), that is needed when integrating raw **HTML** (e.g. into **PHP**, **ASP.NET**, or similar). Also serves as the central icon file read by [the **storybook-design-token** addon](../integration/storybook/token.mdx#design-token-integration). Added as `icon-sprite.html` in `src/token/icons` |
| **jsx**       | **React** version of the same file as the one above, this should be used when working with **React** directly. Called `IconSprite.js` in `src/token/icons`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **storybook** | Writes a selection of files (`icons.svg`, `tokens.css`) to `src/token/storybook`. Those are versions of files already described above, but with automatically added annotations for the **storybook-design-token** addon                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **js**        | This also creates a file (`src/token/storybook/tokens.js`) only used by **Storybook**, to [add some light theming to your instance](../integration/storybook/theming.mdx) based on your **Design Token** set.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Also included is a set of **Storybook** pages documenting your **Design Token** set, using aforementioned **storybook-design-token** addon. You can find them in `docs/tokens`, feel free to adjust them to your liking!

You can also have a look at our **Figma** token file visualizing exactly that token structure:

### **Storybook** integration

Some aspects of our integration with **Storybook** were already covered by the last section about [**Design Token** integration](#design-token-integration). But let's quickly outline **all** of the integration points:

| Integration            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JSON Schema**        | [**Storybook** addon](../integration/storybook/schema.mdx) written by us, to display your [component API](../foundations/components/component-api.md) directly alongside your component (includes inline **JSON** editor using [Monaco](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), with auto-complete).                                                                                       |
| **Design Token**       | Integration with **storybook-design-token** addon, read more about it on our [integration page about it](../integration/storybook/token.mdx#design-token-integration). Also included are **Storybook** pages documenting your **Design Token** set... you can find them in `docs/tokens`.                                                                                                       |
| **Component Token**    | Another [**Storybook**](../integration/storybook/token.mdx#component-token-integration) addon we made. Visualizes your layered **Component Token**, and enables changing values interactively. Changed values get stored in [session storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage?retiredLocale=de), allowing you to test them throughout your whole **Design System**.    |
| **Generated Controls** | Your [component API](../foundations/components/component-api.md) (**JSON Schema** files defining your components structure) get converted to [**Storybook Controls**](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls) automatically. Learn more about this zero-config setup in our dedicated [integrations page about it](../integration/storybook/controls.mdx).                     |
| **Premade Stories**    | Especially when [adapting components closely](./components/adapt.mdx), you can benefit [from our **Storybook** exports](../integration/storybook/stories.mdx). We take great care to export everything (parameters, variants, general setup) for you to re-use while writing your own [Stories](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story).                                 |
| **Theming**            | Finally [some light theming](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/themes.js) gets applied to your **Storybook** instance, based on your **Design Token** set. It should be subdued, but making **Storybook** your own really helps in establishing a sense of ownership!                                                                                              |
| **Composition**        | As part of the left sidebar you have a section titled `@kickstartds/base`, at the very bottom. This gets shown because `@kickstartds/base` is a dependency. **kickstartDS** uses [Storybook composition](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/sharing/storybook-composition) to always include the base documentation (in the correct version used by your Design System) to your **Storybook**. |

**Design Token** get compiled using the [**kickstartDS CLI**](../intro/cli.mdx) as [part of your `package.json`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L22). This converts your **Style Dictionary** from `src/token/dictionary` into all the formats configured in [`sd.config.cjs`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/sd.config.cjs). **Storybook** is [configured to import](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/manager-head.html#L1) our special, annotated `src/token/storybook/tokens.css` (this one includes presenters for **storybook-design-token**) through the [import of the compiled `manager.css`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/manager.scss#L1).

**Theming** is done in [`.storybook/themes.js`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/themes.js), and works by [importing our tokens](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/themes.js#L2) (generated with [their own special **Style Dictionary** format](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/sd.config.cjs#L23-L32)). Those then just [get connected into the **Storybook** theme](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/themes.js#L7-L33) structure in a sensible way.

All the other integrations don't live at **one** central place, but instead require configuration per component / **Story**. So lets look at an example in the `Button` component instead:

- **JSON Schema** integration for the `Button`, loading the dereferenced schema, setting it as a **Story** parameter, and using the `pack` helper throughout [`Button.stories.jsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L3-L21). The rest is handled by our [**Storybook JSON Schema Addon**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-jsonschema/).
- **Component Token** are integrated by [importing the generated `button-tokens.json`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L5), and then [passing that as a parameter](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L18) to the **Story**. Generation of those files per component is done [in `package.json` here](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L44). The rest is handled again by our own addon: [**Storybook Component Tokens Addon**](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@kickstartds/storybook-addon-component-tokens).
- **Generated Controls** are enabled by importing the [helpers `getArgsShared` and `pack`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L3), and [using](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L8) [them](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L10) [throughout](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L15-L16) [the](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L24) **Story**. This takes care of generating all the **Storybook Controls** automatically for you, based off your [component APIs](../foundations/components/component-api.md) (the **JSON Schema** definitions).
- **Premade stories** work by [importing the base **Story**](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L4) first, and [then destructuring it](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L13) into the default export... before setting your [own options as overrides](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx#L14C22-L20).

### **React** integration

There are some **React** concepts already in use deep in **kickstartDS**, and its base components you build upon. This includes using [**Render Props**](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) and adding [**Context** / **Provider**](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to all components, both to enable flexible and efficient mix-and-match of components.

You can see some examples on how this can be applied in [our docs about it](../foundations/components/react.md). Those concepts also get used throughout our main guide ["Create your Design System"](./create/index.mdx), for example when [adding RTE-rendering to the `Headline`](./examples/components/headline.mdx#defining-renderfunctions). All components included in this starter are the result of [example guides](./examples/index.md).

This also easily enables more advanced integrations for your components to offer, later on. For example, when [integrating with a headless CMS like **Sanity**](../integration/react/rich-text-rendering.md#sanity), and using existing [**Render Props**](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) to turn our default **Markdown** capable `RichText` component to one specific to [**Sanity**](https://www.sanity.io/), [using `PortableText`](https://github.com/portabletext/portabletext).

For this starter this means having a file [`src/Providers.jsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/Providers.jsx) in place, that includes all the needed `Provider`s to replace the base components by their customized versions throughout your whole **Design System**. As we've added our own versions of the `Button`, `TeaserBox` and `Section` components in this starter, those are imported and added. We also [support **Bedrock Layout Primitives**](#bedrock-layout-primitives-integration) out-of-the-box, so that provider gets added, too. You can read more about the `Provider` setup in [one of our guides here](./create/components.mdx#add-component-providers).

`Provider`s need to be set [for **Storybook**](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/preview.js#L11), both [for previews](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/preview.js#L55-L64) and the [`Docs` container](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/preview.js#L38-L45) to render components properly. This, too, is covered by our [main guide here](./create/components.mdx#update-storybookpreviewjs).

<Admonition type="tip" title="When you need Providers">
  When you're building a page or application using **React**, you will need to
  add those `Provider`s to your central layout there!
</Admonition>

### **Bedrock Layout Primitives** integration

For the most common use cases we include the [`Section` component](https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/story/base-section--content-boxes) with **kickstartDS**, and it's adapted for [this **Design System** starter](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx), too. It even includes some customizations here, as described in our component example guide ["Extend `Section` component`](./examples/components/section.mdx).

The `Section` component is especially well suited for marketing and landing pages. It provdides general layout options ("horizontal slices" on a page) for components to be put in. You can see all available options here: [**Storybook** Docs for `Section`](https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/docs/base-section--content-boxes).

We also cover the `Section`, and some example uses, in more detail in our ["Layout" section of the docs](../foundations/layout/sections.mdx).

<TextMedia
  mediaAlignment="above-center"
  media={[
    {
      lightboxImage: {
        image: require('./assets/logo-bedrock-inverted.png').default,
        thumb: require('./assets/logo-bedrock-inverted.png').default,
        width: 366,
        height: 235,
        zoomIcon: true,
        alt: 'Figma file cover',
      },
      caption: 'Bedrock Layout Primitives logo',
    },
  ]}
/>

When you have more general layout needs, not covered by simply using a `Section` component, we usually recommend using [**Bedrock Layout Primitives**](https://www.bedrock-layout.dev/) for those cases. We think it meshes really well with our approach to **Design Token**, you simply connect your existing **Design Token** set [to their theming approach](https://www.bedrock-layout.dev/?path=/docs/getting-started-lesson-3-spacing--page). We already provide such an [integration with this starter](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/bedrock/). You can read about this combination in more detail on our ["Foundations"](../foundations/index.mdx) page [about **Bedrock Layout Primitives**](../foundations/layout/bedrock.mdx).

To learn more about **Bedrock Layout Primitves** and why, when and how to use it with **kickstartDS**, and when **Container Queries** might actually be preferrable, you can also read our second release spotlight: [Release Spotlight: Container Queries](https://www.kickstartds.com/blog/release-spotlight-container-queries/).

### **Playroom** integration

We're big proponents of prototyping interface as close to your real **Design System** as possible. For developers, and even code-affine designers, we really love the DX [**Playroom**](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom) by [seek-oss](https://github.com/seek-oss) offers for this.

<TextMedia
  mediaAlignment="above-center"
  media={[
    {
      lightboxImage: {
        image: require('./assets/playroom-demo.gif').default,
        thumb: require('./assets/playroom-demo.gif').default,
        width: 800,
        height: 570,
        zoomIcon: true,
        alt: 'Playroom Demo',
        title: 'Playroom Demo',
        caption: '- image by https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom',
      },
    },
  ]}
/>

This is why we've included a **Playroom** integration with this starter (and because it's actually really easy to do with the way **kickstartDS** is set up) at [`playroom.config.js`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/playroom.config.js).

There's some configuration in **Storybook**s [`.storybook/preview.js`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.storybook/preview.js#L47-L52C5), and all components that should be enabled need to be added in [`src/playroom/components.ts`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/playroom/components.ts). We also added [**Bedrock Layout Primitives**](#bedrock-layout-primitives-integration) support out-of-the-box, there.

To change the included [**Snippets**](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom#snippets) edit [`src/playroom/snippets.ts`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/playroom/snippets.ts), and to change the [theme integration](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom#theme-support) (or even to add multiple themes / white-label testing capabilities to it) have a look at [`src/playroom/FrameComponent.tsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/playroom/FrameComponent.tsx) and the folder [`src/playroom/themes`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/tree/main/src/playroom/themes).

<TextMedia
  mediaAlignment="above-center"
  media={[
    {
      lightboxImage: {
        image: require('./assets/screenshot-multitheme.png').default,
        thumb: require('./assets/screenshot-multitheme.png').default,
        width: 1917,
        height: 909,
        zoomIcon: true,
        alt: 'Multi theme Playroom',
        title: 'Multi theme Playroom',
      },
      caption: 'Multi theme Playroom',
    },
  ]}
/>

Finally, [**TypeScript** support](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom#typescript-support) for all your (and our **kickstartDS** base) components is also already configured. This enables auto-complete for all components, making it really easy and playful to discover components and their properties!

Start your **Playroom**:

```bash
yarn playroom
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Combined use with Storybook">
  You can even [use **Playroom** in your
  **Storybook**](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom#storybook-integration) as
  an addon, just be sure start **Playroom** before starting **Storybook**.
  Because you guessed it: it's already set up!
</Admonition>

### Bundling

With this starter we want to cover the complete life-cycle of a **Design System**. This includes **Bundling** and [**Release handling**](#release-handling). We also want to show what we mean when we say **kickstartDS** is framework-agnostic.

Because you can either use a **Design System** based on **kickstartDS** by working with **React** templates directly, or by alternatively using **CSS** and **JavaScript** bundles to be used with the raw markup generated by components... both cases are covered in this starter.

It's also quite common for both types of usage to coexist for your **Design System**. Your main marketing page might be built with a headless CMS and a modern stack using **React**, while some arcane internal tooling might still use **PHP** for its templating. This setup enables you to serve both!

All bundling is handled by [the `dist:*` tasks](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L24-L31) in `package.json`.

#### Bundling for **HTML** usage

**CSS** bundling with [**Dart Sass**](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass) is done by the [`dist:sass`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L29) script in `package.json`. Just be sure to add all needed component **CSS** to `src/dist.scss`, the compiled output will live at `dist/index.css`.

**JavaScript** bundling with [**esbuild**](https://esbuild.github.io/) is done by the [`dist:js`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L31) script in `package.json`. As with **CSS**, be sure to add all needed component **JavaScript** to [`src/dist.js`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/dist.js), the compiled output will live at `dist/index.js`.

Next to all that configuration, as a start the included ["Integration" **Story**](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/docs/integration.stories.mdx) describes this process to potential developers using your **Design System** this way.

#### Bundling for **React** usage

Consumable **React** component versions are bundled by [`dist:components`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L24) in `package.json`. This also uses [**esbuild**](https://esbuild.github.io/) under the hood, for details about its implementation see [`scripts/bundleComponents.js`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/scripts/bundleComponents.js).

### Release handling

Release handling for this starter is configured to use [**auto**](https://github.com/intuit/auto), and its semantic versioning. We use this setup for **kickstartDS** itself, you can learn more about it [in our documentation](../intro/upgrading.md#semantic-versioning-with-auto).

Configuration is added in [`.autorc`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.autorc), and if you want to enable releases as part of your **CI** / **CD**... you can use [**Circle CI**](https://circleci.com/) with the included configuration file at [`.circleci/config.yml`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/.circleci/config.yml).

We will probably expand on this section, when we have a better picture of everyones setup and needs!

<Admonition type="tip" title="Visual Regression Testing with Chromatic">
  One of the relatively undocumented features is [**Visual Regression
  Testing**](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/visual-testing)
  with [**Chromatic**](https://www.chromatic.com/). This is prepared to be
  usable with [`yarn
  chromatic`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/package.json#L23)
  (also compatible with **CI** / **CD**) in `package.json`.

## Content

We've described all the features extensively now. To wrap up this **README** let's quickly summarize everything included from a "content" perspective: **Components**, **Pages**, **Recipes** and **Docs**.

### Components

As described in the very intro to this **README**, all the included components should be immediately useful in pretty much every **Design System**, but they're also specifically used to showcase features and best practices at play in **kickstartDS**, and to make it easier for you to just add stuff to an already working, well-oiled system:

| Component    | File                                                                                                                                                           | Guide                                                                  | Process                                             |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `Button`     | [`src/components/button/ButtonComponent.tsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/button/ButtonComponent.tsx)                   | [Adapt `Button` component](./examples/components/button.mdx)           | [Adapt a component](./components/adapt.mdx)         |
| `Headline`   | [`src/components/headline/HeadlineComponent.tsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/headline/HeadlineComponent.tsx)           | [Customize `Headline` component](./examples/components/headline.mdx)   | [Customize a component](./components/customize.mdx) |
| `TeaserCard` | [`src/components/teaser-card/TeaserCardComponent.tsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/teaser-card/TeaserCardComponent.tsx) | [Create `TeaserCard` component](./examples/components/teaser-card.mdx) | [Create a component](./components/create.mdx)       |
| `Section`    | [`src/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/components/section/SectionComponent.tsx)               | [Extend `Section` component](./examples/components/section.mdx)        | [Extend a component](./components/extend.mdx)       |

### Recipes

We added one recipe to give you an idea on how you could use those. We've added an [`ArticleTeaser`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/recipes/article/ArticleTeaser.story.jsx) recipe, as one entry in the more general [`Article`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/recipes/article/) recipe category.

Recipes are useful to show how your existing components can be re-used, re-mixed and re-applied to new use cases, avoiding the creation of many specialized components. They serve as great inspiration for consumers of your **Design System**, while also slightly nudging in a certain direction by the examples you decide to showcase!

### Pages

There is one **Page** currently included with this starter in [`src/pages/Demo.story.jsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/pages/Demo.story.jsx), added to **Storybook** by [`src/pages/Pages.stories.jsx`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/src/pages/Pages.stories.jsx).

### Docs

There are two docs pages (the [**Welcome** page](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/docs/welcome.stories.mdx) and the [**Integration** page](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/blob/main/docs/integration.stories.mdx)), and [documentation for all token](#design-token-integration) from your **Design Token** set, included with this starter. Feel free to add further docs pages to your **Design System** in [`docs/`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-starter/tree/main/docs).

## Scripts

Short descriptions for all of the scripts entries in `package.json`:
