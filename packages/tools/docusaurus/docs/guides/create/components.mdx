# 4. Add Components

Now we'll get to the meat of it... adding your first set of components based on **kickstartDS**. Which ones you'll utimately need, and subsequentially build, can vary wildly based on your specific Design System needs. We'll add some exemplary ones now, to illustrate the main ways on offer to do this:

- **`Button`** based on `@kickstartds/base/lib/button`:<br/>**Adapt** existing component, with a reduced set of props. Demo `Provider` and replacement in other components
- **`Headline`** based on `@kickstartds/base/lib/headline`:<br/>**Adapt** existing component (with a reduced set of props), add custom field `switchOrder`
- **`Teaser Card`** based on `@kickstartds/base/lib/teaser-box`:<br/>**Adapt** existing component (with a reduced set of props), reduce complexity by making `link` a simple string... hard-code rest of `Button` props
- **`Section`** based on `@kickstartds/base/lib/section`:<br/>**Adapt** existing component (with a reduced set of props), add custom `background` to showcase extending existing property / `enum`. Also add `link` (display at the end of the `Section`), and let it take multiple entries (1. primary / 2. secondary / 3.+ outline / ghost)

TODO any ideas on where we could add some custom **JavaScript** and custom **CSS** / **SCSS**, to have that covered as part of the guide?

We'll then build our first recipe, using all of the added components to create a teaser component for articles. Recipes are like loose blueprints, that should serve as an inspiration for how components can be combined and remixed, to fit a multitude of use cases! To learn more about recipes, and different kinds of components, we recommend reading **Brad Frosts** excellent article on ["design system components, recipes, and snowflakes"](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-system-components-recipes-and-snowflakes/).

And to bring it full circle, we will add that component to our _Welcome_ page to tease the main pages of our **Storybook**, as a quick entry for users!

Feel free to change these examplary components being implemented around to something you'll actually need instead, if you happen to have something in mind already.<br/>
We'll try adding some components that are commonly needed, so it should be a good starting point either way!

If you want to take a deeper dive on finding your first component set right now, jump over to our Guides around the `Design System Initiative`, and come back to this point later!

TODO this should be linked to Guides following our `Design System Initiative`:<br/>
https://www.kickstartds.com/services/

TODO should also include prominent call out to that `services` page, to advertise our agency services around this!

## Establish structure

TODO Create scaffolding for stuff that's needed for every component added:

- `src/kds.js`
- `src/index.js`
- `src/index.scss`
- `src/Providers.jsx`
- `src/types.ts`

TODO Also add compilation of sass and component js to `package.json`, possibly hook up `scripts` now (aggregated `yarn start`, for example) for better DX

TODO import generated `js` / `css` in `.storybook/preview.js`

TODO add `providerDecorator`

TODO add `unpackDecorator`

## Component implementation

TODO maybe point out adopt vs. adapt in the context of **kickstartDS** here

### Adding our custom `Button` component

TODO write guide, wrap with component that we'll add in this guide (intro / motivation before, completed component code with preview after)

### Adding our custom `Headline` component

TODO write guide, wrap with component that we'll add in this guide (intro / motivation before, completed component code with preview after)

### Adding our custom `Teaser Card` component

TODO write guide, wrap with component that we'll add in this guide (intro / motivation before, completed component code with preview after)

### Adding our custom `Section` component

TODO write guide, wrap with component that we'll add in this guide (intro / motivation before, completed component code with preview after)

### Fine tuning **Component Token**

TODO write some exemplary filler so that **Component Token** are mentioned here as part of the regular workflow.

## Adding an article teaser recipe

TODO combine all components into article teaser

TODO describe `src/docs/LinkProvider.jsx` setup, used to internally link to **Storybook** pages

## Result

TODO add remark about "advanced" ways of customizing components (like completely new CSS / markup, combining multiple components to build a bigger one, etc), that are out of scope for this guide. Reference guides for those (even if those don't exist / only go to pages with a vote feature for guides)

## Next step

TODO add next step -> publishing

## Code Sandbox

TODO create Code Sandbox including exact result after this step of the guide

## Reference for component guides

This will result in a bunch of components that need to be added. Those can be put into different categories, and for each category we will need a Guide outlining that way of adding a component:

- `JSON Schema`
  - **Repurpose existing component**: write new `JSON Schema`, and mainly use one component as the basis... re-wiring properties. All definitions are written manually & explicitly
  - **Repurpose existing components**: build upon last guide, combine multiple components in building the new one. Rest stays the same.
  - **Reference existing component**: write new `JSON Schema`, and mainly use one component as the basis... still re-wiring properties, but also using stuff like `$ref` and `allOf` in the schema. Definitions get re-used as much as possible
  - **Reference existing components**: again, build upon last guide, combine multiple components.
  - **Layering existing component**: show how to layer simple components, like a `Button`, for use in your own Design System. Should show referencing and explicit case of property definition. Explain naming convention for layering!
  - **Overwriting existing component**: show how to overwrite existing property definitions, for example to define a different default
  - **Extending existing component**: show how to extend a component
- `React` template
  - **Customize markup**: Show how you can replace the markup of specific components
  - **Customize markup through `Render Props`**: Show how you can replace behaviour through `Render Props` in certain spots
  - **Switch components with `Context`/`Provider`**: Show how you can select which component to render through the use of `Context`s and `Provider`s, even on a per element basis

All these guides need to include sections on:

- `JSON Schema`
- `React` template

Orthogonal to that, we will also need Guides on additional styling / theming / branding for a bunch of scenarios. Those are not included above, yet.
