# 4. Add Components

Now we'll get to the meat of it... adding your first set of components. Which ones you'll utimately need, and subsequentially build, can vary wildly based on your Design System needs. We'll add some exemplary ones now, to illustrate the main ways we offer to do this:

- Component Workflow 1
- Component Workflow 2
- Component Workflow 3

Feel free to change these examplary components being implemented around to something you'll actually need, if you happen to have something in mind already.<br/>
We'll try adding some components that are commonly needed, so it should be a good starting point either way!

If you want to take a deeper dive on finding your first component set right now, jump over to our Guides around the `Design System Initiative`, and come back to this point later!

TODO This should be linked to Guides following our `Design System Initiative`:<br/>
https://www.kickstartds.com/services/

Should also include prominent call out to that `services` page, to advertise our agency services around this!

This will result in a bunch of components that need to be added. Those can be put into different categories, and for each category we will need a Guide outlining that way of adding a component:

- `JSON Schema`
  - **Repurpose existing component**: write new `JSON Schema`, and mainly use one component as the basis... re-wiring properties. All definitions are written manually & explicitly
  - **Repurpose existing components**: build upon last guide, combine multiple components in building the new one. Rest stays the same.
  - **Reference existing component**: write new `JSON Schema`, and mainly use one component as the basis... still re-wiring properties, but also using stuff like `$ref` and `allOf` in the schema. Definitions get re-used as much as possible
  - **Reference existing components**: again, build upon last guide, combine multiple components.
  - **Layering existing component**: show how to layer simple components, like a `Button`, for use in your own Design System. Should show referencing and explicit case of property definition. Explain naming convention for layering!
  - **Overwriting existing component**: show how to overwrite existing property definitions, for example to define a different default
  - **Extending existing component**: show how to extend a component
- `React` template
  - **Customize markup**: Show how you can replace the markup of specific components
  - **Customize markup through `Render Props`**: Show how you can replace behaviour through `Render Props` in certain spots
  - **Switch components with `Context`/`Provider`**: Show how you can select which component to render through the use of `Context`s and `Provider`s, even on a per element basis

All these guides need to include sections on:

- `JSON Schema`
- `React` template

Orthogonal to that, we will also need Guides on additional styling / theming / branding for a bunch of scenarios. Those are not included above, yet.
