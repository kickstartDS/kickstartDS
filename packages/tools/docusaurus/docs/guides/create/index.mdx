# Create your Design System

## Overview

In this guide we'll get your first Design System, based on **kickstartDS** of course, off the ground in just 5 rather simple steps!

You could say that this is **the** main guide for **kickstartDS**, as it branches out into a bunch of sub guides in the process. Hopefully giving you a well-rounded overview over everything offered and possible in the end. While also creating the draft for your first Design System in the process!

The main steps will go as follows:

1. [Start your Design System](./start.mdx)
2. [Design Application](./design.mdx)
3. [Configure Storybook](./storybook.mdx)
4. [Add Components](./components.mdx)
5. [Publish your Design System](./publish.mdx)

As said previously, the resulting Design System will obviously not be finished by the end of this guide, but you'll have everything set up to start on the real work. We'll add links along the way, when it makes sense, calling out concepts in play or processes to use to find and refine your own personalized use (stuff like choosing an initial component set for your Design System).

## 1. Start your Design System

In this step you'll either create a new project entirely, or learn which basics to add to your existing project to get started!

[Go to step 1](./start.mdx).

## 2. Design Application

We will create your initial Design Token set by applying your corporate design, as a reduced set of `Branding Token`.<br/>
We'll then fine-tune this, as much as sensibly possible in such a guide.
