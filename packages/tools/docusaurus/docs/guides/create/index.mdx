# Create your Design System

## Overview

In this guide we'll get your first Design System, based on **kickstartDS** of course, off the ground in just 5 rather simple steps!

You could say that this is **the** main guide for **kickstartDS**, as it branches out into a bunch of sub guides in the process. Hopefully giving you a well-rounded overview over everything offered and possible in the end. While also creating the draft for your first Design System in the process!

This guide can act as a great reference, too. If you're struggling somewhere, just look up the section concerned with that part of the setup!

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={require('./assets/5-steps.png').default}
    alt="5 steps to your own Design System"
  />
</p>

And if following such a long guide (it's quite comprehensive) seems daunting, we [also have a starter you can use](../use-our-starter.mdx) to have something running in no time (okay, okay... it **will** take you 5 minutes, but not more!). You can always come back to specific sections here then! The starter also includes exactly the same components that are created in this guide, it just adds more features and configuration to your **Design System**.

Just keep this page in mind as a great overview and intro point into **kickstartDS** in general!

The main steps involved go as follows:

1. [Start your **Design System**](./start.mdx)
2. [Design Application](./design.mdx)
3. [Configure **Storybook**](./storybook.mdx)
4. [Add Components](./components.mdx)
5. [Publish your **Design System**](./publish.mdx)

The resulting Design System will obviously not be finished by the end of this guide, but you'll have everything set up to start on the real work. We'll add links along the way when it makes sense, calling out concepts at play, or processes to use, to find and refine your own personalized worfklow with **kickstartDS**, and ultimately your own Design System (stuff like choosing an initial component set for your Design System).

We also recommend having a look over at our guide for the ["Design System Initiative"](../design-system-initiative.md), which concerns itself with questions like:

- What actually **is** my Design System?
- Which components do I **really** need?
- How could I **find out**, which components I'll need?
- Who should be **involved** in that endeavour?
- How to choose a good **place to start**?

This will not be strictly needed for this guide, though. So feel free to just continue on!

## Implementation

### 1. Start your Design System

In this step you'll either create a new project entirely, or learn which basics to add to your existing project to get started!

Start: [Go to step 1](./start.mdx).

A rough outline:

- [Overview](./start.mdx#overview)
- [Create new project](./start.mdx#create-new-project)
- [Add to existing project](./start.mdx#add-to-existing-project)
  - [Dependencies](./start.mdx#dependencies)
- [Result](./start.mdx#result)
- [Next Step](./start.mdx#next-step)

See the result of this step in the **Code Sandbox** below. It's showing specifically the result after this step. You can also view this on **Github** directly in [the `ds-guide` repository](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide), there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on [the branch `step/1`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/1) in the guide:

### 2. Design Application

We will create your initial Design Token set by applying your corporate design, as a reduced set of [**Branding Token**](../../foundations/token/branding-token.mdx).<br/>
We'll then fine-tune this, at least as much as sensibly possible in such a guide. We also compile a first semantic [**Design Token**](../../foundations/token/design-token/index.md) set with our newly created **Style Dictionary**.

Start: [Go to step 2](./design.mdx)

A rough outline:

- [Overview](./design.mdx#overview)
- [Apply branding](./design.mdx#apply-branding)
  - [Initialization](./design.mdx#initialization)
  - [Select **Branding Token**](./design.mdx#select-branding-token)
  - [Apply **Branding Token**](./design.mdx#apply-branding-token)
- [kickstartDS Integration](./design.mdx#kickstartds-integration)
  - [Generate first **Design Token** set](./design.mdx#generate-first-design-token-set)
  - [Compile **Design Token** set](./design.mdx#compile-design-token-set)
  - [Fine tune the design](./design.mdx#fine-tune-the-design)
- [Result](./design.mdx#result)
- [Next Step](./design.mdx#next-step)

See the result of this step in the **Code Sandbox** below. It's showing specifically the result after this step. You can also view this on **Github** directly in [the `ds-guide` repository](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide), there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on [the branch `step/2`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/2) in the guide:

  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Toggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, [or open it directly in your browser](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/2?file=/package.json).

### 3. Configure Storybook

We add **Storybook** here, which includes installing and configuring all the addons we suggest to use. This also includes some we've written ourselves, to really get the most out of **kickstartDS**. We'll also add those, and add integration with **kickstartDS** (tokens, icons, etc). You will end with a fully configured **Storybook**.

Start: [Go to step 3](./storybook.mdx)

A rough outline:

- [Overview](./storybook.mdx#overview)
- [Install **Storybook**](./storybook.mdx#install-storybook)
  - [**Storybook** dependencies](./storybook.mdx#storybook-dependencies)
  - [New `scripts` entries](./storybook.mdx#new-scripts-entries)
- [Configure **Storybook**](./storybook.mdx#configure-storybook)
  - [General configuration](./storybook.mdx#general-configuration)
  - [**Design Token** integration](./storybook.mdx#design-token-integration)
  - [Add **Storybook** theming](./storybook.mdx#add-storybook-theming)
  - [Integrate with **kickstartDS**](./storybook.mdx#integrate-with-kickstartds)
  - [Install remaining addons](./storybook.mdx#install-remaining-addons)
- [Review changes](./storybook.mdx#review-changes)
  - [**HTML** rendering addon](./storybook.mdx#html-rendering-addon)
  - [**Design Token** addon](./storybook.mdx#design-token-addon)
  - [**JSON Schema** addon](./storybook.mdx#json-schema-addon)
  - [**Component Token** addon](./storybook.mdx#component-token-addon)
- [Result](./storybook.mdx#result)
- [Next Step](./storybook.mdx#next-step)

See the result of this step in the **Code Sandbox** below. It's showing specifically the result after this step. You can also view this on **Github** directly in [the `ds-guide` repository](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide), there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on [the branch `step/3`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/3) in the guide:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step%2F3/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fpackage.json&theme=dark&view=editor"

  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Toggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, [or open it directly in your browser](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/3?file=/package.json).

### 4. Add Components

In this part we'll add 4 exemplary components to illustrate the 4 main ways of adding a component to **kickstartDS**. A `Button` to show [adaptation](../components/adapt.mdx), a `Headline` to show [customization](../components/customize.mdx), a `TeaserCard` to show [creation](../components/create.mdx), and finally a `Section` for [extension](../components/extend.mdx).

We'll then add a recipe, demonstrating that concept, combining those 4 components into one big article teaser component! This should hopefully equip you with all the weapons needed to start creating your very own components! We'd love to hear how it went!

Start: [Go to step 4](./components.mdx)

A rough outline:

- [Establish structure](./components.mdx#establish-structure)
  - [Add component `Provider`s](./components.mdx#add-component-providers)
  - [Add `package.json` `scripts`](./components.mdx#add-packagejson-scripts)
- [Component implementation](./components.mdx#component-implementation)
  - [1. Adding our own `Button` component](./components.mdx#1-adding-our-own-button-component)
  - [2. Adding our own `Headline` component](./components.mdx#2-adding-our-own-headline-component)
  - [3. Adding our own `TeaserCard` component](./components.mdx#3-adding-our-own-teasercard-component)
  - [4. Adding our own `Section` component](./components.mdx#4-adding-our-own-section-component)
- [Adding an article teaser recipe](./components.mdx#adding-an-article-teaser-recipe)
- [Result](./components.mdx#result)
- [Next Step](./components.mdx#next-step)

See the result of this step in the **Code Sandbox** below. It's showing specifically the result after this step. You can also view this on **Github** directly in [the `ds-guide` repository](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide), there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on [the branch `step/4`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/4) in the guide:

<iframe
  src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/github/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step%2F4/?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&module=%2Fpackage.json&theme=dark&view=editor"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '500px',
    border: 0,
    borderRadius: '4px',
    overflow: 'hidden',
  }}
  title="ds-guide"
  allow="accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking"
  sandbox="allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts"
></iframe>

Toggle the file browser with the hamburger icon at the top left, [or open it directly in your browser](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/4?file=/package.json).

### 5. Publish your Design System

We're currently in the process of finishing this section. Come back real soon, and it should be here!

Start: [Go to step 5](./publish.mdx)

## Result

This concludes setting up your own **Design System** from scratch. Hopefully everything made sense, and you were able to learn about **kickstartDS**, the reasoning behind decisions taken, and how best to approach the creation of components in a **Design System**-y way.

You can find all the code for this guide, the one also embedded in the **Code Sandboxes** above, on **Github** here:<br/>
https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide

There are branches on that repository containing the result for every major step of this guide:

1. [Start your **Design System**](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/1) on branch `step/1`
2. [Design Application](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/2) on branch `step/2`
3. [Configure **Storybook**](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/3) on branch `step/3`
4. [Add Components](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/4) on branch `step/4`
5. Publish your **Design System** _coming soon..._

You can also have a look at our [**Design System Starter**](../use-our-starter.mdx), which, while including the same components this guide added, also adds lots of additional features out-of-the-box for you.
