# 1. Start your Design System

## Overview

Setting up your own Design System can be done in one of two ways:

1. By [creating a new project](#create-new-project) for your Design System to live in, or
2. by [adding everything to an existing project](#add-to-existing-project)

## Create new project

Start in a fresh directory inside your terminal. This should be the directory all your Design System code will live in, and that will also be pushed to a Git host, later on. It shouldn't include a `.git` folder, yet! We'll use `~/projects/my-design-system` here, with `~` denoting the users' home directory.

First, let's create a `Git` repository:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/projects/my-design-system
$ cd ~/projects/my-design-system
$ git init

> Initialized empty Git repository in ~/projects/my-design-system/.git/
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Working with the terminal">
  If any of the commands related to `git` or `npm` / `node` fail for you, or you need help working with the terminal, have a look at our `Getting Started` [page about Environment configuration](../../intro/environment.md).

Additionally you might not use `nvm` for `Node` version management. Just skip those sections, and ensure the correct version for your project is installed and active!

</Admonition>

Next we'll add a `.gitignore` file to the repository, that will be built up through the following sections to exclude generated code files:

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

Add the `node_modules` folder to it for now:

```bash .gitignore
# Node
node_modules
```

<CH.Section>
Then we'll add a `.nvmrc` file specifying the use of `Node` `16.14` for this project (this is the version **kickstartDS** currently works off of) to our project root:

<CH.Code>

```bash .nvmrc
16.14
```

</CH.Code>

</CH.Section>

Call `nvm use` right after, to activate the correct `Node` and `npm` versions:

```bash
$ nvm use

> Found '~/projects/my-design-system/.nvmrc' with version <16.14>
> Now using node v16.14.2 (npm v8.19.2)
```

Finally we'll make it a valid `npm` package, too:

```bash
$ npm init

> About to write to ~/projects/my-design-system/package.json:
> ...
```

<CH.Section>

Enter the prompted information, and you'll end up with a `package.json` describing your freshly made `npm` package. Use `dist/index.js` for the [entry point](focus://5), this is where our bundled code will live. The rest is pretty much up to your liking! It should look roughly like this:

<CH.Code>

```json package.json mark=5[12:24]
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

</CH.Code>

</CH.Section>

With this you can continue with `Add to existing project`. From here on out the steps will be the same.<br/>
You'll just find that, in comparison to having an existing project, you'll probably not find any of the steps to be optional!

<Admonition type="tip" title="Code samples and paths">
  Notice the small filename tab at the top of every code sample featured in these very docs? That tab always includes the full path of the file shown. This can be helpful when unsure on where a particular file should be added inside your project.

If there's only a filename, and not a path, in there, it means the file lives at the projects root... where your `package.json`, `.git` folder, etc reside!

</Admonition>

## Add to existing project

In your terminal, switch to the project that you want to add **kickstartDS** to first. We'll be adding some dependencies, some glue code and configuration to hook everything up.

Some of the following steps might be optional for your personal setup, so feel free to skip them.<br/>
For example: you might already have `React` installed in your project, so you wouldn't have to complete that part of the setup!

<Admonition type="tip" title="`npm` vs `yarn` vs ...">
  In this guide we'll be using `yarn` as our package manager of choice. Feel free to use your preferred solution instead.<br/>
  For more details see our [page about Environment configuration](../../intro/environment.md).

_For example_: if you were using `npm`, and you'd encounter the following command to run `yarn add react@17 react-dom@17`... just replace `yarn` with `npm` and run `npm add react@17 react-dom@17` instead.

### Dependencies

First of all we need to add some dependencies to our project:

<CH.Scrollycoding>

#### Start with existing `package.json`

If you're adding to an existing project, just imagine the same lines being added to your existing `package.json`.<br/>
We'll pretend to start fresh:

<CH.Code>

```json package.json
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

</CH.Code>

---

#### Add `React`

<CH.Code>

```json package.json focus=11:14
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "17",
    "react-dom": "17"
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

If your project was not using `React` before, you should add a compatible version (**kickstartDS** currently uses `React 17`) of it now:

```bash
yarn add react@17 react-dom@17
```

---

#### Change **SemVer** requirement

<CH.Code>

```json package.json focus=12:13
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

We want to get newer versions for **React** 17, so we change the import slightly! [Learn more about those restrictions](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).

---

#### Add `kickstartDS`

<CH.Code>

```json package.json focus=12
{
  "name": "@my/design-system",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Design System for all @MY needs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Jonas Ulrich",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@kickstartds/base": "^2.0.2",
    "react": "^17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "^17.0.2"
  }
}
```

</CH.Code>

Next we'll add the **kickstartDS** dependencies themselves. We start out by adding our **base** module (`@kickstartds/base`), which contains all of the base components, to get started:

```bash
yarn add @kickstartds/base
```

Learn more about the different modules **kickstartDS** has to offer in our [overview here](../../foundations/modules.md).

</CH.Scrollycoding>

## Result

Our repository is initialized. We can now connect it to a **Git** host, or just continue with the guide without pushing our code to a registry. If you'd like to learn more about **Git** hosts, see our [Environments page about it](../../intro/environment.md).

## Next Step

We'll continue by applying our branding to **kickstartDS**, which will result in a bunch of token files (`JSON`) being added to the project.<br/>
This will also give us the opportunity to set up **Storybook**, and get a first visual representation of our Design System in the browser!

## Code Sandbox

See the result of this step in the **Code Sandbox** below. It's showing specifically the result after this step. You can also view this on **Github** directly in [the `ds-guide` repository](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide), there's a branch for every step... and we're currently on [the branch `step/1`](https://github.com/kickstartDS/ds-guide/tree/step/1) in the guide:
