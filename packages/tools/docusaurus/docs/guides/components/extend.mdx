# Extend a component

## Definition

## Extension process

<Admonition type="tip" title="Adaptation process as a base line">
  If you've read our ["Adapt a component"](./adapt.mdx) guide you probably already know this:

This guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by **kickstartDS** components, when used as a base component. We'll also skip over, or significantly shorten, parts already covered by that guide. If unsure about something, best cross-reference it!
