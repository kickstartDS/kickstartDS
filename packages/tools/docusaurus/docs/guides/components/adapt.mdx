# Adapt a component

## Definition

Adapting a component means to use the component "directly". This includes using the same name and purpose for it. The obvious example would be using the `Button` provided by **kickstartDS** for the `Button` as part of your own Design System. It typically doesn't make a lot of sense to find a different name for this component, because the name is fitting and well-known.

  text="the process of changing to suit different conditions"
/>

The word "directly" above is set in quotes, because even though we re-use the component with the same intent, we will still want to reduce the offered options (component properties) to better suit our needs. A simple [component API](../../foundations/components/component-api.md) helps in creating a shared understanding of what a component is, and does.

<Admonition type="tip" title="kickstartDS component properties">
  Components as delivered by **kickstartDS** modules (like `@kickstartDS/base` for the `Button`) have to support a wide range of use cases, as they get used to build a multitude of different, but custom, `Button` implementations in the end.

This means reducing the set of properties, given by the [component API](../../foundations/components/component-api.md) of a **kickstartDS** component, to your needs is explicitly something that should be done! You still benefit by the broad, underlying foundation giving you flexibility when further adapting your own version of it. For example when adding a variant including an `Icon`, which was not part of your `Button` before.

</Admonition>

For a detailed example of adapting the `Button` component, have a look [at our component example](../examples/components/button.mdx) guide describing just that!

## Adaptation process

There's one big assupmtion made when choosing the adaptation process: you've already identified a component you'd like to use... and it already offers all the options you'll need. Let's call it the base component.

This greatly simplifies finding a component definition, as it means simply selecting props you'd like to use for yourself, from a well-defined set.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Adaptation process as a base line">
  Each of the other ways of adding a component to your Design System based on **kickstartDS** build upon this adapdation process.

Which is to say, you'll always want to reduce the props of **kickstartDS** components used as a base, as described here. But sometimes that may not be enough. You might need a slightly different version of the component, or its props (learn more in our guide ["Customize a component"](./customize.mdx), or view ["Customize `Headline` component"](../examples/components/headline.mdx) as an example), or you may want to add something completely new to it (learn more in our guide ["Extend a component"](./extend.mdx), or view ["Extend `Section` component"](../examples/components/section.mdx) as an example).

</Admonition>

If you don't have component in mind yet, you're probably served better by our guide ["Create a component"](./create.mdx). In that guide, you'll start off without a specific component in mind. This means defining a structure (someting you probably have an idea about already) first, and then mapping that structure to a fitting component second.

We also have an example for this with ["Create `Teaser Card` component"](../examples/components/teaser-card.mdx).

### 1. Component Definition

We start by defining a component API. As touched on before, this mainly means selecting a set of props from the pool of props available through your selected base component.

We'll use the `Button` component throughout this guide to illustrate concepts. This will not be an exhaustive example, though. For that have a look at our guide ["Adapt `Button` component"](../examples/components/button.mdx).

#### Purpose

For the adaptation process the main purpose of a component is already defined by the selected base component. Nontheless the purpose for even a well-known type of component, like the `Button`, can vary from one Design System to the next. So it helps to think about the specific purpose the selected base component will serve in **your** Design System.

As a hypothetical: you might decide to **really** only use components looking like a `Button` for elements the user directly interacts with... but not for links. This would be a big part of the components purpose, and thus should inform your property selection and naming process.

#### Structure

Before we start implementing, we'll want to define a first rough draft of our component API. Defining a name and a small description per property goes a long way in focussing you on the core of your component.

Let's keep using the `Button` as an example. We're starting with the following properties with that one:

| Property        | Description                                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`         | Text used on button                                             |
| `variant`       | Choose one of the styles from the list                          |
| `inverted`      | If the button should be inverted                                |
| `size`          | Choose a size between small, medium and large                   |
| `href`          | Link used for button                                            |
| `iconBefore`    | Icon identifier for icon before the button text                 |
| `iconAfter`     | Icon identifier for icon after the button text                  |
| `fillAnimation` | Add fill animation on hover                                     |
| `iconAnimation` | Add icon animation on hover                                     |
| `type`          | Select the type attribute for the button                        |
| `value`         | Define a value attribute for the button                         |
| `name`          | Define a name attribute for the button                          |
| `disabled`      | Set the disabled attribute for the button                       |
| `newTab`        | Open link in new Tab                                            |
| `className`     | Add additional css classes that should be applied to the button |
| `component`     | Optional custom component identifier                            |

One potential set of props, it's the one used in our guide ["Adapt `Button` component"](../examples/components/button.mdx) if you're wondering, would be this:

| Property   | Description                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `label`    | Text content to display inside the button                                      |
| `target`   | Target that should be linked, makes the button behave like a link semantically |
| `variant`  | Variant of button to be used                                                   |
| `size`     | Size of button to use                                                          |
| `disabled` | Whether the button should be disabled                                          |

We took `label`, `variant`, `size` and `disabled` directly, and renamed `href` to `target` for our version of the `Button`.

In our hypothetical above, we would probably drop the option of specifying `href` / `target` altogether.

### 2. Component Creation

#### **JSON Schema** definition

We establish the structure of components by creating a **JSON Schema** for them, defining their component API in code.

For an abridged version of that process, have a look at the `Button` again:

<CH.Spotlight>
<CH.Code>
```json button.schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.kickstartds.com/base/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component to display links and call-to-actions",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "inverted": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "href": { ... },
    "iconBefore": { ... },
    "iconAfter": { ... },
    "fillAnimation": { ... },
    "iconAnimation": { ... },
    "type": { ... },
    "value": { ... },
    "name": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
    "newTab": { ... },
    "className": { ... },
    "component": { ... }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

````
</CH.Code>

#### Original `Button`

This is the "full" button component API / **JSON Schema**. We've just reduced the property definitions.

<CH.Code>
```json button.schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.kickstartds.com/base/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component to display links and call-to-actions",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "inverted": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "href": { ... },
    "iconBefore": { ... },
    "iconAfter": { ... },
    "fillAnimation": { ... },
    "iconAnimation": { ... },
    "type": { ... },
    "value": { ... },
    "name": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
    "newTab": { ... },
    "className": { ... },
    "component": { ... }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

````

</CH.Code>

---

#### Select from available props

Let's highlight the ones we've identified when thinking about our component structure before.

<CH.Code>
```json button.schema.json focus=8,9,11,12,20
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.kickstartds.com/base/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component to display links and call-to-actions",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "inverted": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "href": { ... },
    "iconBefore": { ... },
    "iconAfter": { ... },
    "fillAnimation": { ... },
    "iconAnimation": { ... },
    "type": { ... },
    "value": { ... },
    "name": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
    "newTab": { ... },
    "className": { ... },
    "component": { ... }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

````

</CH.Code>

---

#### Create your own component API

Subsequently we add exactly those fields to our own components component API / **JSON Schema**...

<CH.Code>
```json mybutton.schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.mydesignsystem.com/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component used for user interaction",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "href": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

```

```json button.schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.kickstartds.com/base/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component to display links and call-to-actions",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "inverted": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "href": { ... },
    "iconBefore": { ... },
    "iconAfter": { ... },
    "fillAnimation": { ... },
    "iconAnimation": { ... },
    "type": { ... },
    "value": { ... },
    "name": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
    "newTab": { ... },
    "className": { ... },
    "component": { ... }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

</CH.Code>

---

#### Renaming props

... and we can even rename props in the process.

<CH.Code>
```json mybutton.schema.json focus=11
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.mydesignsystem.com/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component used for user interaction",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "target": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}

```

```json button.schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.kickstartds.com/base/button.schema.json",
  "title": "Button",
  "description": "Component to display links and call-to-actions",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "label": { ... },
    "variant": { ... },
    "inverted": { ... },
    "size": { ... },
    "href": { ... },
    "iconBefore": { ... },
    "iconAfter": { ... },
    "fillAnimation": { ... },
    "iconAnimation": { ... },
    "type": { ... },
    "value": { ... },
    "name": { ... },
    "disabled": { ... },
    "newTab": { ... },
    "className": { ... },
    "component": { ... }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

</CH.Code>

</CH.Spotlight>

For the full / extended version of adapting a `Button` have a look at our guide ["Adapt `Button` component"](../examples/components/button.mdx).

#### **React** Template

## Technical debt

## Examples

We continuously expand our [component example guides](../examples/components/index.md), below we've collected the ones acting as a good sample of the adaptation process.

### Adapt `Button` component

In [this example component guide](../examples/components/button.mdx) we adapt the `Button` component (as part of the `@kickstartDS/base` module) to use it for buttons in our own Design System. We drastically reduce the options used, and offered, in our own adaptation. We remove all options that include having an `Icon` displayed as part of the `Button`, for example.

This is what the result looks like (TODO replace with preview from real Storybook, not ours):
