# Customize a component

## Definition

## Customization process

<Admonition type="tip" title="Adaptation process as a base line">
  If you've read our guide ["Adapt a component"](./adapt.mdx) you probably already know this:

This guide expects you to reduce the set of props offered by **kickstartDS** components, while also customizing existing props, and even adding new ones. Feel free to have a look at that guide first, if unsure.
