# Extend `Section` component

This guided example shows how you'd add components to your Design System that use a **kickstartDS** base component pretty directly. But unlike just [adapting a component](../../components/adapt.mdx), extending a component also involves adding something to it, or changing the way certain things work under the hood, by composing multiple **kickstartDS** base components (whereas [customizing a component](../../components/customize.mdx) does that by adding changes to the customized components **React** template). This expands possible applications of existing **kickstartDS** components greatly.

Even while using the component rather directly from **kickstartDS**, you'll want to find the correct set of properties for your own use case. Components in **kickstartDS** come equipped with properties for a wide range of possible use cases, so it makes sense to reduce those to the ones you really need... to make components easier to understand, use and reason about!

We call this type of workflow **Extension**. Learn more about it in [our dedicated guide](../../components/extend.mdx) about it. If you're unsure about something, have a look over there. We go into more background detail there about what we're doing here.

Not touching the actual markup generated by components let's us get by without adding any custom styling (**CSS** / **SCSS**) to it. We simply reuse the already existing [**Design Token**](../../../foundations/token/design-token/index.md) and component structure.

## Overview

This is how the result of this guide will look like:

<iframe
  src="https://60dc476b80673e003b4258d6-czyzkgbgek.chromatic.com/iframe.html?args=&id=base-section--content-boxes&viewMode=story"
  width="800"
  height="600"
></iframe>

TODO add `iframe` to real example

It will only need two simple steps for that:

1. Component Definition, and
2. Component Creation

For more details about those steps, have a look at [the guide about different component processes](../../components/index.mdx) and their shared structure.

## Requirements

This guide assumes that you already have a working Design System, that is based on **kickstartDS**, running.<br/>
If that's not the case, follow our [Create your Design System](../../create/index.mdx) guide.

## 1. Component Definition

### Purpose

<TextMedia
  ks-theme="docs"
  media={[
    {
      lightboxImage: {
        image: require('./assets/section-usage.png').default,
        thumb: require('./assets/section-usage.png').default,
        width: 1904,
        height: 903,
        zoomIcon: true,
        gallery: 'section-use',
      },
      caption: "Examples of section component variants"
    }
  ]}
  mediaAlignment="intext-right"
  text="We've found that we'd love to use the existing **kickstartDS** `Section`, but it's not quite flexible enough for our taste. We'd like to add more call-to-actions to our page, which mostly consists of such `Section`s, and don't need as much flexibility for the included headline.

We take `width`, `gutter`, `mode`, `content`, `spaceBefore`, `spaceAfter` and `inverted` directly from the `Section`, and rename `background` to `style` for our version of it. And crucially we add our own property `ctas`, to hold call-to-actions, into the mix, while reducing the complexity of `headline` significantly... from mapping to all of the `Headline` properties, to just a single `string` type prop setting its content.

We also keep the name `Section`, as it fits our use case well enough already."
/>

### Structure

Defining the structure of a component means finding the [component API](../../../foundations/components/component-api.md) for it:

| Property          | Type      | Description                             |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `headline`        | `string`  | Headline for the section                |
| `width`           | `enum`    | Width of section to use                 |
| `gutter`          | `enum`    | Size of gutter to use                   |
| `mode`            | `enum`    | Layout mode used for section contents   |
| `content`         | `array`   | Allowed content for the section         |
| `style`           | `enum`    | Style of section, influences background |
| `spaceBefore`     | `enum`    | Amount of spacing before the section    |
| `spaceAfter`      | `enum`    | Amount of spacing after the section     |
| `inverted`        | `boolean` | Whether to invert the section           |
| `ctas`            | `array`   | Call-to-actions to show                 |
| `ctas[].label *`  | `string`  | Label for the Call to action            |
| `ctas[].target *` | `string`  | Target for the Call to action           |

Fields that should be required are marked with a `*`.

While directly helping us get a better grasp on our new component, these will also be used to write our `JSON Schema` later!

## 2. Component Creation

We like to colocate components. This means to have all involved files next to each other in the same folder; the template (`.jsx` / `.tsx`), potential CSS / SASS (`.css` / `.scss`), JavaScript (`.js` / `.ts`), our JSON Schema component definition (`.schema.json`), and so on.

So we start by creating the directory `src/components/section`, from our Design System repository root:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components/section
```

This is the folder we'll add new files to in the coming few paragraphs.

### **JSON Schema** definition

First file we'll create is the `JSON Schema` definition, encoding the structure we've defined for our component before:

<CH.Scrollycoding>
#### Start with just the boilerplate for a component definition

This includes all necessarily required values for a valid component definition in **kickstartDS**.

To learn more about our use of `JSON Schema`, read our Concepts (TODO create + link) article.

<CH.Code>
```json src/components/section/section.schema.json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "",
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {}
}
```
</CH.Code>

---

#### Add basic info describing component

We start by adding a `title`, `description` and `$id` attribute. The correct `$id` depends on your Design System configuration. We'll assume you've created components before, living under the schema prefix `http://schema.mydesignsystem.com`.

<CH.Code>
```json src/components/section/section.schema.json focus=3:5
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "$id": "http://schema.mydesignsystem.com/section.schema.json",
  "title": "Section",
  "description": "Component used to layout components into pages",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {}
}
```
</CH.Code>

</CH.Scrollycoding>

TODO finish **JSON Schema**

This concludes creating the `JSON Schema`. When running the schema generation in our Design System again, we should now automatically end up with a corresponding type definition to be used in creation of the template in the next step:

<CH.Code>
```ts src/components/section/SectionProps.ts
/* eslint-disable */
/**
 * This file was automatically generated by json-schema-to-typescript.
 * DO NOT MODIFY IT BY HAND. Instead, modify the source JSONSchema file,
 * and run `yarn run schema` to regenerate this file.
