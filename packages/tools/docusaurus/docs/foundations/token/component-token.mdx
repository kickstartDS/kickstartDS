# Component Token

Component Token are an exhaustive representation of every value associated with a specific component. They by default inherit from [design Token](/docs/basics/token/design-token). Whenever possible, we recommend to keep pointing these to the foundational Token, rather than change into hard values such as hex codes. Nevertheless you can use these to fully match a component's appearance to a given design layout or specification.
