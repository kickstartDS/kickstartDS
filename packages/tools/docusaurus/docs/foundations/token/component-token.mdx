# Component Token

Component Token are a representation of values associated with a specific component. They by default inherit from [Design Token](/docs/foundations/token/design-token). Whenever possible, we recommend to keep pointing these to the foundational token, rather than change into hard values such as hex codes. Nevertheless you can use these to fully match a components appearance to a given design layout or specification.
