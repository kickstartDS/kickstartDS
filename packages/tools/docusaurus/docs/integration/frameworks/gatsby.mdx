# Gatsby

**Gatsby** is a framework helping developers build websites faster and with better results overall, while being compatible with a wide range of other systems out-of-the-box.

<Quote

  byline="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/why-gatsby"
  source="Why Gatsby page"
  text="Gatsby enables developers to build fast, secure, and powerful websites using a React-based framework and innovative data layer that makes integrating different content, APIs, and services into one web experience incredibly simple."
/>

<br />

We have a feature complete **Gatsby** theme coming up, which automatically enables all of your (own, custom!) components to be usable on your website without additional work. You can see the Gatsby theme in action today, on our own website:<br/>
https://www.kickstartDS.com

This includes Gatsby Node definitions for **kickstartDS** compatible pages, and already existing resolvers to even connect to one of the following CMS as a headless content provider:

- WordPress (see our own blog for an example of that combination): https://www.kickstartDS.com/blog/
- Contentful (see our glossary for an example of that combination): https://www.kickstartDS.com/glossary/typescript/
- Netlify CMS (see our main marketing- and landing pages): https://www.kickstartDS.com/
- MDX

Ready-made templates include (you can preview them in our **Storybook**):

- Content Page ([Storybook](https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/story/pages--integrations))
- Glossary Entry Page ([Storybook](https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/story/pages--glossary-entry))
- Blog List Page ([Storybook](https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/story/pages--blog-list))
- Blog Detail Page ([Storybook](https://www.kickstartds.com/storybook/?path=/story/pages--blog-post))

This allows for extremely flexible combinations of data sources for your website, all while using one uniform frontend (your Design System) **and** minimizing implementation work, even for your completely new and custom transformer.

It will also handle the following things for you out-of-the-box:

- Integrated SEO independent of used source systems
- Centralized menu concept
- Performance optimization
