# Next.js

We've already implemented a bunch of **Next.js** based apps and pages using **kickstartDS** successfully. It's compatible pretty much out-of-the-box, only some slight transpilation may be needed (see below on how to do that).

There's some obvious overlap between **Next.js** and **kickstartDS** in the choice of **React** as the frontend technology. We also benefit from some key concepts implemented in our components **React** templates when building **Next.js** based pages and apps.

To learn more about **Next.js**, visit [their official website](https://nextjs.org/).

## Usage with **kickstartDS**

Some tips on combining **Next.js** and **kickstartDS**.

### Features

Some of those **React** concepts that are at the core of **kickstartDS** components:

- Use of [Context / Provider](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)
- Use of [renderProps](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html)
- Purely [functional components](https://blog.logrocket.com/what-are-react-pure-functional-components/)

For some real world examples on how this can help you:

- see [how to replace **Rich Text**](../react/rich-text-rendering.md) (like **Markdown**) in all **kickstartDS** components
- see [how to replace **Image**](../react/image-rendering.md) handling in all **kickstartDS** components

### Transpilation

Transpilation of our packages is needed because we deliver components as [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules). Those are not natively understood by **Next.js**. Additionally we have `import` statements loading component **CSS** inside of those exported components that you'll import. Those will also have to be processed by the **Next.js** pipeline, which by default ignores `node_modules` where your **kickstartDS** dependencies live.

We recommend using [`next-transpile-modules`](https://github.com/martpie/next-transpile-modules) for transpilation.

#### Configuration

To add transpilation to your **Next.js** based project, first add the **npm** dependency:

```bash
yarn add next-transpile-modules
```

Then add the following code snippets to your `next.config.js`, at your projects root:

```js next.config.js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')([
  '@kickstartds/core',
  '@kickstartds/base',
]);

module.exports = withTM({});
```

There's a great chance that file already includes configuration for your project. In that case, make sure ([as the official docs mention](https://github.com/martpie/next-transpile-modules#examples)) to include `withTM` as the outermost plugin.

To learn more about **Next.js** plugins and `next.config.js`, see [the official **Next.js** docs on that](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/introduction).

#### Using other / additional modules

If you're using other **kickstartDS** dependencies, you'll have to add them to that list above. For example, when using `@kickstartds/form`, `@kickstartds/content` and `@kickstartds/blog`, too:

```js next.config.js
const withTM = require('next-transpile-modules')([
  '@kickstartds/core',
  '@kickstartds/base',
  '@kickstartds/blog',
  '@kickstartds/content',
  '@kickstartds/form',
]);

module.exports = withTM({});
```
