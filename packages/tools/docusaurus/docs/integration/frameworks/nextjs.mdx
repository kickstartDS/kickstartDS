# Next.js

We've already implemented a bunch of **Next.js** based apps and pages using **kickstartDS** successfully. It's compatible pretty much out-of-the-box, only some slight transpilation may be needed (see below on how to do that).

<Quote

  byline="https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs/what-is-nextjs"
  source="What is Next.js? page"
  text="Next.js is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications."
/>

<br />

Some of the **React** concepts at the core of **kickstartDS** components are a great fit to build a **Next.js** based interface:

- TODO document Context / Provider for images and results
- TODO document renderProps
- TODO maybe document component maps?

If you want to know more, feel free to get in contact! We'll flesh out this part of our documentation soon, you may also sign up for a notification when this is done TODO add CTA to subscribe.

TODO document transpilation needed
