# Theming

There are some limited options to theming **Storybook**. But while this might seem like a small thing, it can really help make your **Storybook** feel like home.

To learn more about theming in **Storybook**, have a look at [their dedicated docs for that](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/theming).

## Usage with **kickstartDS**

You already have a well established **Design Token** set when working with a Design System based on **kickstartDS**. In our mission to always provide sensible defaults, that improve your status quo without a big upfront investment of time, we provide a transformer in our **Style Dictionary** implementation (it's the tool backing your **Design Token** set, [learn more](#) TODO add link). That transformer takes your **Design Token** set and converts it to **JavaScript** values that can be imported in **Storybooks** theme file (`.storybook/themes.js`).

As this is a generated file, based on your configuration, it's content will vary, but it should a little like this:

```js .storybook/themes.js
import { create } from '@storybook/theming';
import * as tokens from '../src/token/storybook/tokens';

export const light = create({
  base: 'light',

  colorPrimary: tokens.KsColorPrimaryBase,
  colorSecondary: tokens.KsColorPrimaryBase,

  // UI
  appBg: tokens.KsColorPrimaryToBg9Base,
  appContentBg: tokens.KsBackgroundColorDefaultBase,
  appBorderColor: tokens.KsColorPrimaryAlpha2Base,
  appBorderRadius: tokens.KsBorderRadiusCard,

  // Typography
  fontBase: tokens.KsFontFamilyInterface,
  fontCode: tokens.KsFontFamilyMono,

  // Text colors
  textColor: tokens.KsTextColorDefaultBase,
  textInverseColor: tokens.KsTextColorDefaultInvertedBase,

  // Toolbar default and active colors
  barTextColor: tokens.KsColorPrimaryAlpha6Base,
  barSelectedColor: tokens.KsColorPrimaryBase,
  barBg: tokens.KsBackgroundColorDefaultBase,

  // Form colors
  inputBg: tokens.KsBackgroundColorInterfaceInteractiveBase,
  inputBorder: tokens.KsColorFgToBg7Base,
  inputTextColor: tokens.KsTextColorInterfaceInteractiveBase,
  inputBorderRadius: tokens.KsBorderRadiusControl,

  brandTitle: 'Your kickstartDS Storybook',
  brandUrl: 'https://www.kickstartDS.com',
  brandImage: '/logo.svg',
});
```

This automatically connects your **Design Token** set to your **Storybook** theme, while also setting your logo.

## Example

Have a look at our very own **kickstartDS** instance to see our colors (as an example) at work:

<img
  src={require('./assets/screenshot-branding.png').default}
  alt="Image showing our corporate branding used to theme Storybook"
/>

<br />
<br />

To learn how to use this in your own **Storybook**, have a look at [part three of our "Create your Design System"](../../guides/create/storybook.mdx#add-storybook-theming) guide for an in-depth explanation.
