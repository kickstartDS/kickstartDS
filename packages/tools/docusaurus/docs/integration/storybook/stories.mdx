# Premade Stories

**Stories** are at the heart of **Storybook** (who whould've guessed 😅). They are the stage and workbench for your components. [As with **Storybook Controls**](./controls.mdx) you don't have to start from zero with **kickstartDS**.

## Usage with **kickstartDS**

We provide support in two key areas when it comes to **Storybook** stories:

1. Premade **Design Token** stories
2. Premade component stories

See below for an explanation what these can do for you!

### 1. Premade **Design Token** stories

Our premade **Design Token** stories showcase your **Design Token** set instantly, neatly categorized and grouped by their semantic meaning established through **kickstartDS**.

See the integration page about ["Design & Component Token" in this very section](./token.mdx#design-token-integration) to see a detailed description, and how you'd use them for your own Design System.

### 2. Premade component stories

When building your own components based on **kickstartDS**, often you'll find that there's one single component, or a very limited set of components, that back your new creation. It'd make sense to re-use existing documentation for those, too!

To enable re-use, we `export` stories as part of every component that's part of our modules. You can simply import those to set useful defaults for your own component stories, inheriting from the base component.

#### Simple example `Button`

Let's see how this would look like when building a story for your own, hypothetical `Button` component (based on the `@kickstartDS/base` component `Button`):

<CH.Spotlight>
<CH.Code>
```jsx src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx
import { Button } from "./ButtonComponent";
import { pack, getArgsShared } from "@kickstartds/core/lib/storybook/helpers";
import ButtonStories from "@kickstartds/base/lib/button/button.stories";
import schema from "./button.schema.dereffed.json";

const { defaultArgs: args, argTypes } = getArgsShared(schema);

const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export default {
  ...ButtonStories,
  title: "Components/Button",
  args,
  argTypes,
  parameters: {
    jsonschema: schema,
  },
};
```
</CH.Code>

---

##### Import existing stories

First we import the existing `ButtonStories` from `@kickstartds/base`.

<CH.Code>
```jsx src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx focus=3
import { Button } from "./ButtonComponent";
import { pack, getArgsShared } from "@kickstartds/core/lib/storybook/helpers";
import ButtonStories from "@kickstartds/base/lib/button/button.stories";
import schema from "./button.schema.dereffed.json";

const { defaultArgs: args, argTypes } = getArgsShared(schema);

const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export default {
  ...ButtonStories,
  title: "Components/Button",
  args,
  argTypes,
  parameters: {
    jsonschema: schema,
  },
};
```
</CH.Code>

---

##### Add them as defaults

Destructure them into your `default` export as defaults, and overwrite just what you want to need to.

<CH.Code>
```jsx src/components/button/Button.stories.jsx focus=11
import { Button } from "./ButtonComponent";
import { pack, getArgsShared } from "@kickstartds/core/lib/storybook/helpers";
import ButtonStories from "@kickstartds/base/lib/button/button.stories";
import schema from "./button.schema.dereffed.json";

const { defaultArgs: args, argTypes } = getArgsShared(schema);

const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

export default {
  ...ButtonStories,
  title: "Components/Button",
  args,
  argTypes,
  parameters: {
    jsonschema: schema,
  },
};
```
</CH.Code>
</CH.Spotlight>

That's it, and as always this should help you focus on the important details! Have a look at the ["Adapt `Button` component"](../../guides/examples/components/button.mdx) guide for a full version of the `Button` component shown here.

This also works when working with more than one component:

#### Complex example `Section`

For a more complex example, involving multiple base components see the `Section` we've created in our ["Create your Design System" guide](../../guides/create/components.mdx):

TODO find a fitting example involving importing from multiple stories

#### In action

To see this in action, have a look at the base story for our **kickstartDS** `Button` component, for example:<br/>
https://master--6080932e6ca776002127f0c5.chromatic.com/?path=/story/base-button--default

Then compare it to the story for the `Button` in our own **kickstartDS** Design System (which, of course, is also based on **kickstartDS**), which re-uses the base story from above:<br/>
